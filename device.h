/*! \class Device

    A generic per device supervisor for routers and end-devices.

    This class doesn't and MUST not know anything specific about devices.
    Device specific details are defined in device description files.

    As a starting point a Device only knows the MAC address called `DeviceKey` in this context.

    Each Device has a event driven state machine. As a side effect it is self healing, meaning that
    every missing piece like ZCL attributes or ZDP descriptors will be queried automatically.
    If an error or timeout occurs the process is retried later on.

    For sleeping end-devices the event/awake notifies to the state machine that the
    device is listening. Based on this even deep sleepers can be reached. Note that the event
    is not emitted on each Rx from an device but only when it is certain that the devices is listening
    e.g. MAC Data Requests, specific commands, Poll Control Cluster Checkings, etc.

    Currently implemented:

    - ZDP Node Descriptor
    - ZDP Active Endpoints
    - ZDP Simple Descriptors
    - ZCL Basic cluster modelid and manufacturer name


    Configurations like bindings and ZCL attribute reporting are maintained and verified continously. These may
    be specified in device description files or are configured dynamically via REST-API, e.g. a switch controls
    a certain group.

    TODO

    A Device maintains sub-resources which may represent lights, sensors or any other device. The device state given
    by the REST-API like on/off, brightness or thermostat configuration is kept in RecourceItems per sub-device.
    The state machine continiously verifies that a given state will be set, this is different from the former and
    common approach of fire commands and hope for the best.

    Commands MAY have a time to life (TTL) for example to not switch off a light after 3 hours when it becomes reachable.

    This class doesn't know much about ZCL attributes, it should operate mainly on ResourceItems which encapsulate
    how underlying ZCL attributes are written, parsed or queried. The same Resource item, like state/temperature might
    have a different configuration between devices. All this class sees is a state/temperature item or more precisely
    â€” just a ResouceItem in a certain state.
